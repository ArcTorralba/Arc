    <h1>Heart Rate Monitor</h1>
    <p>A heart rate monitor (HRM) is a personal monitoring device that allows one to measure/display heart rate in real time or record the heart rate for later study. It is largely used to gather heart rate data while performing various types of physical exercise.<br>
        In 1977, a Finnish professor from the University of Oulu, Seppo Säynäjäkangas, invented the first battery operated fingertip heart rate monitor as a training aid for the Finnish National Cross Country Ski team and he went on to found Polar Electro.</p>
